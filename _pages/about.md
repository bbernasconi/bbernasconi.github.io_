I'm currently a post-doctoral researcher in Linguistics at the Department of Humanities of the University of Turin. I'm working within the PRIN PNRR 2022 project "DiverSITa: Diversity in spoken Italian" which aims to expand the largest corpus of spoken Italian currently available, KIParla (Mauri et al. 2019)
My research interests involve semantics and pragmatics within the frameworks of Cognitive Linguistics and Construction Grammar. I work on various languages such as Russian and Italian. Lately, I've been working on language contact and plurilingualism too.
